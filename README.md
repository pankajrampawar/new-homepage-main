## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

The major learning while making the project shift about the paradigm shift I had, I used to make teh website for PC first and then for mobile phones but now when I made it first for mobile phone (while keeping the layout for pc in mind) my work pace increased and the code become more and more effecient.

The second thing I learned was building the overlay, making its postioning proper was the major challenge I faced, but with the help of chatgpt it all became easier.

### Continued development

I am satisfied with the results but will still have to improve upon the css as I firmly believe that it can be made shorter.
